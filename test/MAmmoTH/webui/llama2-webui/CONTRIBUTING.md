# Contributing to [llama2-webui](https://github.com/liltom-eth/llama2-webui)

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug

- Discussing the current state of the code
- Update README.md
- Submitting a PR

## Using GitHub's [issues](https://github.com/liltom-eth/llama2-webui/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/liltom-eth/llama2-webui/issues). It's that easy!

Thanks for **[jlb1504](https://github.com/jlb1504)** for reporting the [first issue](https://github.com/liltom-eth/llama2-webui/issues/1)!

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give a sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

Proposing new features are also welcome.
