I am interested in the physics of accretion and outflows, and also in using the supermassive blackholes (SMBHs) that power the AGN phenomena as astrophysical and cosmological tools. To study accretion and outflows, I utilize multiwavelength spectroscopy (IR, optical, UV, and X-ray) and simulations, with the photoionization code CLOUDY. In my research on SMBHs as tools, I rely on investigating scaling relations between the SMBH masses and the properties of the host galaxies in order to shed light on the formation and evolution of galaxies in general. As an extension of accretion physics investigation, I am interested in investigating the possibility of AGN jets launching ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). As a cosmological tool, I am working on the use of quasars, a bright class of distant AGN, as standard candles to build a quasar Hubble diagram in order to probe the equation of state of dark energy.
